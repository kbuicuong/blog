Created using Laravel

This is my first Laravel project, it's a simple blog site with simple functionalities. 

The user is able to register, login, create posts, edit posts, create tags, edit tags, add comments, 
edit comments, add a photo to their posts, and edit the photo.

This blog was created by following the tutorial on youtube.com by DevMarketer
